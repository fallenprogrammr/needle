needle
======

Needle is a command line file search utility for a Microsoft Team Foundation Server repository.

My initial plan is to start with a very basic search utility which will allow searching in files, a feature that TFS 2010 lacks as of 1/30/2012.

Future plan is for the usage of async / await and multithread the search to make it faster.
